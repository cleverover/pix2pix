# pix2pix

Hello! 

Last week I spent working on "pix2pix" project, which tries to generate a cat photo from the cat's contours.

This project was created in school of practical programming and data analysis from HSE SPB and JetBrains.

We made a new cats dataset, wich includes ~40000 images. It's may be useful for your projects.

You may just run it and look at the images wich makes our cGAN model on the "Weights & Biases" website. Or you may play with parameters and networks's architucture in this code)

Also it's interesting to check if this model learned to generate a dog photo from his contures, for example.  

Bonus: our cGAN converts from black and white pictures to color ones quite well. Train it and use it.

Good luck!
